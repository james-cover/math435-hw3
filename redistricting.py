# Redistricting Analysis with GerryChain
# This script analyzes Pennsylvaniaâ€™s voting district plans
# using the GerryChain library.
#
# Question 1: Compares three FiveThirtyEight plans (Dem-, GOP-, Compactness-favoring)
#              and computes Republican wins & efficiency gaps.
#
# Question 2: Runs a Markov Chain (ReCom) ensemble starting
#              from the compactness plan and measures distribution
#              of Republican wins and efficiency gaps.
#
# Output:
#   - Console summary of results
#   - Two histogram plots: rep_wins_hist.png, efficiency_gap_hist.png
